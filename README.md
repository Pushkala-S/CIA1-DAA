# CIA1-DAA
I have used c language for this assessment
The reason why i chose c is that i have learnt c programing for data structures last semester.


# Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path tree starting from some source node. A shortest path tree is a tree that connects all nodes in the graph back to the source node and has the property that the length of any path from the source node to any other node in the graph is minimized.
# Prim's algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree for the graph, which is a tree that connects all nodes in the graph and has the least total cost among all trees that connect all the nodes.
# kruskals algorithm is used to construct the shortest spanning tree from the vertex having the lowest weight in the graph.
# The difference between dijkstras ,prims and kruskals is that Dijkstra’s algorithm finds the shortest path, but Prim’s  and kruskals algorithm finds the MST
# Prim’s and kruskals  algorithm can handle negative edge weights, but Dijkstra’s algorithm may fail to accurately compute distances if at least one negative edge weight exists.
# the difference between prims and kruskals is that  Prim’s algorithm works by choosing the adjacent vertices from the selected set of vertices. In contrast, the Kruskal’s algorithm selects least weight edges instead of using adjacency list, it organizes the edges by their weights.
